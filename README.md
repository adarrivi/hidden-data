===========

### Short History
This project looks for different _hidden_ patterns in text books.

### Long History
Inspired by the following [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcRSBuGBro0) about how [The Large Hadron Collider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) works, I tried to emulate the same workflow: data production, filtering, aggregation, processing and display.
